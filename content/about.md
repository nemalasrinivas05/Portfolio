# Hello There, I'm Srinivas

## About me

I'm Srinivas, I'm a developer and a quick learner. I am currently learning about Nuxt at Claranet, which means I am diving into modern web development using the Vue.js ecosystem, with a focus on features like server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and building scalable, high-performance web applications. My role at Claranet likely involves gaining hands-on experience with these technologies to improve both your development skills and your understanding of full-stack web applications.

## What I am Learning in Claranet

Nuxt is a powerful framework for building Vue.js applications, focusing on server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation, and powerful features that make development more efficient. It provides an intuitive structure and setup to streamline Vue development while offering features like:

1.Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Improves SEO and enhances performance by rendering pages on the server.

2.Static Site Generation (SSG): Allows you to generate static HTML files for better performance and deployment flexibility.

3.File-Based Routing: Automatically generates routes based on the pages directory, simplifying navigation.

4.Built-in Middleware: Enables control of requests and routing logic with ease.

5.Modules and Plugins: Extends functionality without reinventing the wheel (e.g., SEO optimization, image optimization).

6.API Integration: Easily connect to REST APIs or GraphQL backends.

## What software/hardware do I required to learn Nuxt?

Here's a list of software and hardware required:

- Computer
- Internet Connection
- VSCode
- Node.js and npm
- Nuxt CLI
- Chrome
- GIT
- Terminal or Command Line
- ScreenFlow (Mac only)
